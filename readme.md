# Typescript Notes

Notes Based on Todd Motto's TS course

The course uses a older verion of TS `2.6.2`, as of present I have `4.3.4` on my computer

Since this is just basic notes, I wont update the project to the latest version (for now at least)

## Contents

1. General Notes

2. ES6/7 and TypeScript

3. Primitive Types

4. Typescript Types

5. Type Aliases and Assertions

6. Diving into interfaces

7. Class, Properties and Inheritance

## File Structure

WIP

For now the notes are in seperate folders.
Might change this later.
All the code is in the starter-project folder so far.

## How it works

1. Look at the TS compiler section in General Notes for details
